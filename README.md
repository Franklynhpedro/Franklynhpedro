Believer in agile software development, team work and Clean Code. Always questioning the status quo and wanting to improve. Able and willing to think outside the box.

Remember what your goals are at all times and stick to them. Don't let the comments from others put you down and take you off your path. It's you vs you.

<h3 align="left">Want to Build Your Own?</h3>
<p align="left">
Do you like my profile and want to build your own? It's very simple. GitHub recently added a new feature called **Profile Readmes**. For it to work, do the following:

1. Create a *special* GitHub repository with your username as repository name. My username is `Franklynhpedro` so my profile readme repository has the name `Franklynhpedro`.
1. Add a `README.md` to this repository.
1. Put some cool content about yourself (or anything you want) into `README.md`.

And that's about it. The `README.md` of your profile readme repository will be displayed on your profile page. If you need inspiration, you can check out [this repository](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme) which contains a curated list of nice profile readme repositories.</p>
